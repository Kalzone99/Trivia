## Trivia App 🎯

This is my first React + Vite + TypeScript project, built during my Full Stack Developer formation at BeCode. The app is a Quiz Trivia Game that generates random questions from the Trivia API. It features a smooth interface, animated UI, and a "Last Played" section to track recent games.

## 🚀 Features

React + Vite + TypeScript – Fast development with modern JavaScript tooling.
Trivia API Integration – Fetches real-time trivia questions from an external API.
React Router – Enables seamless navigation across different game pages.
Local Storage – Stores and displays the last 10 played games.
Lottie Animations – Smooth UI animations for answer validation.
Tailwind CSS – Clean and responsive UI styling.
@headlessui/react – Implements accessible modal components.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

React + Vite – Core frontend framework and fast build tool.
TypeScript – Adds type safety and better development experience.
React Router – Enables navigation between home, game, and settings pages.
Trivia API – Provides dynamic and random quiz questions.
Local Storage – Saves previous game results for quick access.
Lottie React – Handles animated success/failure feedback.
Tailwind CSS – Modern, utility-first CSS framework for styling.
